# Pattern Recognition Indicators

Pattern recognition indicators identify specific price patterns that may indicate continuation or reversal of market trends. These patterns represent recurring market behavior that can provide insights into future price movements. Unlike mathematical indicators, pattern recognition relies on identifying specific price formations.

## Types of Pattern Recognition

This library implements pattern recognition for:

### Candlestick Patterns

Candlestick patterns are formations created by one or more candlesticks that may indicate potential market reversals or continuations.

```rust
let patterns = recognize_patterns(&dataframe)?;
```

**Parameters:**
- `dataframe`: The price data with open, high, low, and close columns

**Candlestick Pattern Types:**

1. **Reversal Patterns**
   - Doji: Single candlestick with very small body (opening and closing prices nearly the same)
   - Hammer/Hanging Man: Single candlestick with small body and long lower shadow
   - Shooting Star/Inverted Hammer: Single candlestick with small body and long upper shadow
   - Engulfing Patterns: Two-candle pattern where second candle completely engulfs the first
   - Harami: Two-candle pattern where second candle is contained within the first
   - Morning/Evening Star: Three-candle reversal pattern

2. **Continuation Patterns**
   - Marubozu: Candlestick with no or very small shadows
   - Spinning Top: Candlestick with small body and upper and lower shadows of similar length
   - Windows (Gaps): Price gaps that occur between two candlesticks

**Interpretation:**
- Each pattern has specific characteristics and implications
- Context matters - patterns have different reliability in different market conditions
- Confirmation is important - wait for the next candlestick to confirm the pattern
- Multiple timeframe analysis improves reliability

## Trading Strategies with Pattern Recognition

### Candlestick Pattern Strategies

1. **Reversal Strategy**
   - Identify reversal candlestick patterns at support/resistance levels
   - Enter trades in the direction of the expected reversal
   - Place stops beyond the pattern's high/low

2. **Continuation Strategy**
   - Identify continuation patterns during established trends
   - Enter in the trend direction after pattern completion
   - Use pattern dimensions to set profit targets

3. **Multiple Pattern Confirmation**
   - Look for clusters of patterns suggesting the same outcome
   - Increase position size when multiple patterns align
   - Combine with other technical indicators for confirmation

## Pattern Recognition Principles

1. **Context is Crucial**: Patterns are more reliable at key support/resistance levels
2. **Volume Confirmation**: Strong volume during pattern formation increases reliability
3. **Trend Consideration**: Patterns work best when aligned with the broader trend
4. **Pattern Size Matters**: Larger patterns (relative to recent price action) tend to be more significant
5. **Timeframe Alignment**: Patterns occurring across multiple timeframes increase reliability

## Limitations

- **Subjectivity**: Pattern identification can be subjective and vary between traders
- **False Signals**: Not all patterns lead to the expected outcome
- **Hindsight Bias**: Patterns are often easier to identify in retrospect than in real-time
- **Market Evolution**: Market dynamics change over time, affecting pattern reliability
- **Overreliance**: Focusing solely on patterns without broader context can lead to poor results

## Best Practices

- Always consider the broader market context when interpreting patterns
- Use multiple timeframe analysis to confirm patterns
- Combine pattern recognition with other technical indicators
- Pay attention to volume during pattern formation
- Practice pattern recognition to improve identification skills
- Use proper risk management regardless of pattern reliability
- Consider the market environment (trending vs. ranging) when evaluating patterns
- Maintain a trading journal to track pattern performance in your trading
